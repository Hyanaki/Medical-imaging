Medical-Imaging is a course I attended when I was student in France.
For this course, we had the opportunity to work on several projects:

# Image segmentation

From 3D images of human brain, we extract 2D images and apply K-means algorithm to segment Grey matter from white matter and Cerebrospinal fluid.
With a K-means algorithm, it is also possible to visualize the different surfaces of the 3D brain.

During the IRM acquisition, a bias can be generated on the images. In this work we learnt how to correct the bias.

The results are introduced in a report written in French. (TP1.pdf)

# Medical Visual Servoing

From images captured with a 2D ultrasoung probe, the pixel intensity within a window is collected to analyze the motion of the probe.
The motion is then compensated with visual servoing method.

Results are introduced in a report written in French (TP2.pdf)
